This repo will help you to make a competetive line follower robot.
Using these resources Team Falcon came runner up in  2 competetions (in one competetion completing an arena in 16seconds)
Main Components Used:
-->Arduino Nano
-->TB6612FNG
-->QTR-8 Array Sensor
-->N20 gear motor (300 rpm)
-->Buck Converter (MP 1584)

Every Robot has its own tuining values.So adjust PID values according to your robot 
Start with value of P and D 
After Setting value of P, set the value of D to 1 and increase until you see a lesser amount of  wobbling.

Bonus tips:
--> If the battery voltage changes it may ruin your pid values.So attatch a buck converter and set it to a constant voltage.
--> First set your desired speed and then start with tuining of your robot.
